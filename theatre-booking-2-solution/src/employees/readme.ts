// We will store employees
// We can also store relationship between those employees e.g. manager -> employee
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Is non-existent employee not found ?
// can we store a single employee and then find them ?
// if there is no manager for an employee then we should get no relationship
// if we add a relationship between two non-existing employees it is rejected
// if we add a relationship between 1 existing and 1 non-existing employee it is rejected
// if we add a relationship between 2 existing employees can it be found ?
// can we find the team under a specific manager ?
